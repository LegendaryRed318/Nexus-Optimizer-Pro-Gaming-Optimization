Build me a full cross-platform AI-powered optimization app for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS.

### Name:
Nexus Optimizer Pro (sleek, gamer-friendly brand identity)

### Design Inspiration:
Take UI/UX inspiration from:
- Razer Cortex – gamer-focused neon accents, animated stats.
- Surge – clean optimization modules with smooth animations.
- EXM Tweaks – powerful but accessible tweak tools.
- NVIDIA GeForce Experience – game-specific optimization menus.

Design must:
- Default to dark mode with toggle for light mode.
- Neon glow accents (green, blue, customizable).
- Real-time hardware monitoring widgets (CPU, GPU, RAM, Network).
- Modular optimization cards for System, Network, GPU, and Games.
- Animated transitions and hover effects.
- Sidebar navigation with icons + text labels.

### 7. FPS Overlay Module
**Purpose:** Provide a built-in, real-time performance overlay without third-party tools.

**Core Stats Display:**
- FPS
- CPU usage %
- GPU usage %
- RAM usage %
- CPU temperature
- GPU temperature
- Network ping

**Customization:**
- Position: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.
- Font size and color options.
- Background opacity (0%–60%).
- Toggle elements on/off.
- Theme presets (minimal, full detail, retro, neon).

**Hotkeys:**
- Toggle overlay: CTRL+SHIFT+O (Win/Linux), CMD+SHIFT+O (Mac).
- Cycle positions: CTRL+SHIFT+P.
- Hide/show via chatbot commands.

**Performance:**
- Lightweight thread/process.
- CPU < 1%, GPU < 0.5% usage.
- Low-level hooking:
  - Windows: DirectX & OpenGL.
  - Mac: Metal API.
  - Linux: Vulkan/OpenGL.
- Auto-refresh to match monitor refresh rate (max 144Hz).

**Integration:**
- Works with DirectX, Vulkan, OpenGL, Metal games.
- Chatbot can report overlay stats.
- Logs data for performance history.

**Extras:**
- Animated “monitoring active” icon.
- Optional FPS/ping mini-graph.
- No admin rights needed for toggle.

**UI Example:**
Minimal → `FPS: 144 | Ping: 18ms`  
Full →
